1.a: The two most called methods in vector.h are the operator[](unsigned int) and length()const with the operator[] being called 500500 times and the length() being called 502500.
1.b: The vector's copy constructor is called 1000 times.
1.c: the copy constructor is called 1000 times because its referenced when the average function is ran.
1.d: fixed the code to make vect a pass by reference variable inside the average function.
1.e the fix works and the vector copy constructior is only called 1 time.

2.a: the line in main() that consumes the most instructions is line 27 (calculating the average).
2.b: 9812 instruction reads are spent calculating the average.
2.c:fixed code
2.d: instruction reads are spent calculating the average after fix.
